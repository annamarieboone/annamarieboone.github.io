      <p>Will republicans lose their majority after the midterm elections in November? I worked on this project doing graphics and site development with <a href="" target="_blank">Judy Keen</a>, who wrote a great story using historical data to address this question.</p>
      <p>There were a few versions of these graphics we went through during a fairly quick — one week — turnaround period for this piece. They were distilled down and became extremely simple, which helped readability and comprehension. I also made <a href="https://twitter.com/annamarieboone/status/965987613638356994" target="_blank">a gif</a> to share with the story.</p>

      <p>Minneapolis was the sports hub of the country for a few weeks before the Super Bowl, and this guide was born to help show people all the things there are to do in the Twin Cities — besides the game.</p>
      <p>This project was a huge undertaking, and one I will write more in-depth about in the future. The guide was an unprecedented effort for me in UI/UX design thinking, the importance of prototyping, and the ability to adjust on the go. In the end, it got over 305k views, and the functionality exceeded expectations. There was a <a href="https://twitter.com/annamarieboone/status/956548155587342341" target="_blank">promotional video</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/StarTribune/status/956520028161150976" target="_blank">gif</a> to accompany social media sharing.</p>

      <p>The Super Bowl coming to Minneapolis gave me a chance to work with the sports department and chart the prices of Super Bowl tickets. Turns out I could have afforded to go when it first started, but inflation pretty quickly stopped my chances of seeing it live.</p>
      <p>This was my first project with a solo byline and one I was really excited about. There was <a href="https://twitter.com/annamarieboone/status/959514302787960832">a gif</a> used to help promote sharing.</p>

      <p>This project was my first time using CSS transitions and animations in the intro art of a story. This profile was a perspective of Bud many don't see, so cycling through who he is as people expect and then the fullscreen, color photo of him in his basement helped to set the (unexpected) scene.

      <p>To help aid in the feel of a continued series, there is naviagtion at the top of the page and after his reasoning for his predictions. The photo treatment each week was done primarily by me, and helped to establish the real sporty nature of the sports.</p>
